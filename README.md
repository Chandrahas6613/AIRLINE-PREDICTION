# AIRLINE-PREDICTION

It is a machine learning project that allows us to predict the ticket cost for traveling by flight to reach our destination. This model predicts the ticket cost by training and testing the given dataset (this includes timings of the flight, name of the flight, departure date, arrival date, source, destination, route, duration, and total stops). The final output includes a user-friendly web interface, where users can input flight details and receive real-time price predictions generated by the machine learning model.
